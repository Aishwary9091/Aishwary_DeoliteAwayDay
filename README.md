# Aishwary_DeoliteAwayDay

## Notes:

Deloitte Digital is rewarding their employees in recognition for their hard work for range of successful projects by organising a "Deloitte Digital Away Day". Due to high demand across the firm a number of activities were proposed and a selection of them have been approved. Given there are time constraints, you have been asked to help event organisers by writing a program to accommodate various activities for the day.
Organisers have provided you with the following useful information: 1. The employees will be divided into various teams and each team will be performing various activities
2. Activities start from 9am until lunch is served at 12 noon 3. Activities resume from 1pm and must finish in time for a presentation to be delivered by external speaker on â€œStaff Motivation" 4. The presentation can start no earlier than 4:00 and no later than 5:00 5. All activity lengths are either in minutes (not hours) or sprint (15 minutes) 6. Due to high spirit of the team there needs to be no gap between each activity

## Dividing the requirement into small iterations:

1.The application will  load the activities to be performed from the text file provided in the src/main/resources folder 
2. After reading the activities ,activities are scheduled based on their durations . 
3.Every team will performing different activities
4.Number of teams involved can vary from one to four.
5. Lunch break is at 12.
6.Presentation starts between 4pm and 5pm and  all the activities are important to be a part of the schedule 
but it  depends on the duration of the order of the activities
